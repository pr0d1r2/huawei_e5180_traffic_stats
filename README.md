# huawei_e5180_traffic_stats

Collect traffic stats for Huawei E5180 LTE modem in ruby.

## Why?

As mobile companies give shitty data cap of 100GB on "unlimited" plans (after which you land with 2M/384k connection) we want to know internet usage distribution.

## Setup

```
bundle install
```

## Usage:

Start collecting stats by:

```
ruby collect_huawei_e5180_traffic_stats.rb
```
